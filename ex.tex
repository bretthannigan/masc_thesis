\chapter{Design Examples}
\label{ch:Examples}

The optimization framework developed in \autoref{ch:Optimization} may now be used to produce loop filters using various criteria from \autoref{ch:Stability}. In Sections~\ref{sec:ex-hinf} to \ref{sec:ex-l1}, a 5th-order \gls{DT} modulator with a 32 times \gls{OSR} is designed for \gls{EEG} recording applications with several different stability criteria. This application demands a \gls{LP} design to capture \gls{EEG} signals from the delta band (below \SI{4}{\hertz}) to the gamma band (up to \SI{100}{\hertz}) inclusive. Therefore, the modulator will be clocked at \SI{6.4}{\kilo\hertz} to avoid aliasing. In \autoref{sec:ex-ct}, a 3rd-order \gls{CT} modulator with a 32 times \gls{OSR} is shown to demonstrate the method applied to \gls{CT} designs. This example is intended for audio applications, i.e., \gls{LP} signals with Nyquist frequency \SI{44.1}{\kilo\hertz}.

\section{Design Using $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ Stability Criterion}
\label{sec:ex-hinf}

The $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ design procedure is done by solving the optimization problem in \autoref{eq:perf} for performance while the constraint in \autoref{eq:hinf} promotes a stable design. Lemma~\ref{lem:gkyp} is used for the former while Lemma~\ref{lem:gkyp} combined with the auxiliary conditions in \autoref{eq:gkyp-ifi} for the latter, which implicitly forces the \gls{NTF} to be stable. For a Lee criterion of $\gamma_\infty = 1.5$, the optimization problem converges to the loop filter transfer function:

\begin{equation*}
	H_1(z) = \frac{0.799\left(z^2 - 1.59z + 0.657\right)\left(z^2 - 1.92z + 0.966\right)}{\left(z - 0.954\right)\left(z^2 - 1.95z + 0.953\right)\left(z^2 - 1.99z + 0.994\right)}.
\end{equation*}

The sensitivity function of this filter can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:ntf-hinf}. Note that the Lee criterion for stability is satisfied across all frequencies and the peak gain in the signal band has been minimized to \SI{-64}{\deci\bel} by the GKYP lemma. This compares favourably (in the $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ sense) to the design produced with the toolbox in \cite[Appx. B]{Schreier1997}, which has peak gain in the signal band of \SI{-55}{\deci\bel}\footnote{The Delta Sigma Toolbox command \texttt{synthesizeNTF(5,~32,~1,~1.5,~0)} was used to produce the transfer function used in this comparison.}.

Like most high-order designs using the Lee criterion, stability is conditional on input amplitude. A simulation of this can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:sqnr-hinf}, also performed with the Delta Sigma Toolbox. A peak signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR) of \SI{86}{\deci\bel} at an input amplitude of 0.71 was achieved with a maximum stable input amplitude (MSIA) of 0.71 and a minimum resolvable input amplitude of \SI{-91}{\deci\bel} full scale (FS). The comparable toolbox design achieved a very similar peak SQNR but with a slightly better MSIA and minimum resolvable input amplitdue of 0.76 and \SI{-96}{\deci\bel} FS, respectively. The trade-off between stability and performance as the Lee criterion goal is changed is shown in \autoref{fig:lee-perf-stab}. For Lee criterion targets below 2.1, a feasible design is not found. An abrupt onset of instability is observed for designs with Lee criterion above 2.1.

\section{Design Using Root Locus Stability Criterion}
\label{sec:ex-rl}

The root locus design technique is done by solving the optimization problem in \autoref{eq:perf} for performance while the constraint in \autoref{eq:rl} is enforced for robustness against the quantizer gain. Similar to the previous example, Lemma~\ref{lem:gkyp} is applied to the $r \rightarrow e$ sensitivity channel and Lemma~\ref{lem:gkyp} along with conditions in \autoref{eq:gkyp-ifi} to the $w \rightarrow z$ robustness channel. While a sufficient condition for stability would be that the root locus remains in the stable region for all positive quantizer gains $K$, this produces a very conservative design. Instead, the quantizer gain robustness criterion can be used to enhance the stable input range of Design~\ref{sec:ex-hinf}. Instablility in sigma delta modulators is often associated with low quantizer gains. To improve stability, the lower bound of the quantizer gain, $k_l$, may be changed and the optimization problem solved. Thus $k_l$ is a parameter that trades off performance and stability, which is shown in \autoref{fig:robust-perf-stab}. With some trial-and-error, $k_l=0.1$ results in a modulator that is full-scale stable under simulation. The solver converges to the loop transfer function:

\begin{equation*}
	H_1(z) = \frac{1.80\left(z - 0.806\right)\left(z - 0.641\right)\left(z^2 - 1.93z + 0.949\right)}{\left(z - 0.607\right)\left(z^2 - 1.94z + 0.943\right)\left(z^2 - 1.98z + 0.990\right)}.
\end{equation*}

The shaded markers indicate the selected design $k_l$ value. The root locus is entirely within the unit circle for $k_l \leq 0.075$.} \label{fig:robust-perf-stab}
\end{figure}

The robustness and sensitivity channels are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ntf-rl}. The $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ norm of the $G_{zw}(z)$ transfer function is less than 1 for all frequencies, showing that the system is stable for all norm-bounded quantizer gains in the range $\left[k_l, k_h\right] = \left[0.1, \infty\right)$. The root locus is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rl-rl} confirms that this is the case. A simulation like done previously shows that system is empirically stable for input amplitudes up to full scale. As expected when stability is increased, the empirical peak SQNR is reduced to \SI{66}{\deci\bel} with the minimum resolvable input amplitude at \SI{-52}{\deci\bel} FS.

\section{Design Using $\mathcal{H}_2$ Stability Criterion}
\label{sec:ex-h2}

The $\mathcal{H}_2$ design technique is done by again solving the optimization problem in \autoref{eq:perf} for performance while maintaining the stability constraint from \autoref{eq:h2}. The former uses Lemma~\ref{lem:gkyp} while the latter uses Theorem~\ref{thm:h2}. In this example, the goal is to design a modulator for the same specifications as that from \autoref{sec:ex-hinf} but with slightly increased stability. One advantage of the $\mathcal{H}_2$ criterion is that there is a more systematic way to target a specific \gls{MSIA}. For this example, the quantizer input signal is modelled with the Gaussian \gls{PDF}. For a target \gls{MSIA} of 0.90, the criterion is satisfied if $||G_{er}(z)||^2_2<1.29$. Using this constraint along with the performance optimization, the solver converges. Even after many iterations, the \gls{LF} contains a pole-zero cancellation indicating that the optimization scheme was not able to find a feasible 5th-order design. After simplification, the loop filter transfer function is:

\begin{equation*}
	H_1(z) = \frac{0.536\left(z - 0.690\right)\left(z^2 - 1.94z + 0.967\right)}{\left(z^2 - 1.97z + 0.968\right)\left(z^2 - 1.99z + 0.995\right)}.
\end{equation*}

Computing the NTF gain for the optimum value of $K = 0.877$, we obtain $||G_{er}(z)||_2 = 1.28$, indicating that the 2-norm constraint was satisfied. Because this stability criteria is only an approximation, the empirical MSIA is 0.84. The peak SQNR was found to be \SI{78}{\deci\bel} at an input amplitude of 0.73. The minimum resolvable input amplitude was found to be \SI{-77}{\deci\bel} FS. These measurements can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:sqnr-h2}.
