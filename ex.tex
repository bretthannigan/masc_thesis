\chapter{Design Examples}
\label{ch:Examples}

The optimization framework developed in \autoref{ch:Optimization} may now be used to produce loop filters using various criteria from \autoref{ch:Stability}. In Sections~\ref{sec:ex-hinf} to \ref{sec:ex-l1} below, a 5th-order \gls{DT} modulator with a 32 times \gls{OSR} is designed for \gls{EEG} recording applications using several different stability criteria. This application demands a \gls{LP} design to capture \gls{EEG} signals from the delta band (below \SI{4}{\hertz}) to the gamma band (up to \SI{100}{\hertz}) inclusive. Therefore, the modulator will be clocked at \SI{6.4}{\kilo\hertz} to avoid aliasing. In \autoref{sec:ex-ct}, a 3rd-order \gls{CT} modulator with a 32 times \gls{OSR} is shown to demonstrate the method as applied to \gls{CT} designs. This example is intended for audio applications, i.e., \gls{LP} signals with Nyquist frequency \SI{44.1}{\kilo\hertz}.

\section{Design Using \gls{Hinf} Stability Criterion}
\label{sec:ex-hinf}

The \gls{Hinf} design procedure is done by solving the \gls{GKYP} optimization problem for performance while the \gls{Hinf} constraint promotes a stable design. Lemma~\ref{lem:gkyp} is used for the former while Lemma~\ref{lem:gkyp} combined with the auxiliary conditions in \autoref{eq:gkyp-ifi} is used for the latter, which implicitly forces the \gls{NTF} to be stable. For a Lee criterion of $\gamma_\infty = 1.5$, the optimization problem converges to the loop filter transfer function:

\begin{equation*}
	H_1(z) = \frac{0.799\left(z^2 - 1.59z + 0.657\right)\left(z^2 - 1.92z + 0.966\right)}{\left(z - 0.954\right)\left(z^2 - 1.95z + 0.953\right)\left(z^2 - 1.99z + 0.994\right)}.
\end{equation*}

The sensitivity function of this filter can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:ntf-hinf}. Note that the Lee criterion for stability is satisfied across all frequencies and the peak gain in the signal band has been minimized to \SI{-64}{\deci\bel} by the \gls{GKYP} lemma. This compares favourably (in the \gls{Hinf} sense) to the design produced with the toolbox in \cite[Appx. B]{Schreier1997}, which has peak gain in the signal band of \SI{-55}{\deci\bel}\footnote{The Delta Sigma Toolbox command \texttt{synthesizeNTF(5,~32,~1,~1.5,~0)} was used to produce the transfer function used in this comparison.}.

Like most high-order designs using the Lee criterion, stability is conditional on input amplitude. A simulation of this can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:sqnr-hinf}, also performed with the Delta Sigma Toolbox. A peak \gls{SQNR} of \SI{86}{\deci\bel} at an input amplitude of 0.71 was achieved with a \gls{MSIA} of 0.71 and a minimum resolvable input amplitude of \SI{-91}{\deci\bel} \gls{FS}. The comparable toolbox design achieved a very similar peak \gls{SQNR} but with a slightly better \gls{MSIA} and \gls{MSIA} of 0.76 and \SI{-96}{\deci\bel} \gls{FS}, respectively. The trade-off between stability and performance as the Lee criterion goal is changed is shown in \autoref{fig:lee-perf-stab}. For Lee criterion targets above 2.1, a feasible design is not found. An abrupt onset of instability is observed for designs with Lee criterion above 2.1.

\section{Design Using Root Locus Stability Criterion}
\label{sec:ex-rl}

The root locus design technique is done by solving the \gls{GKYP} optimization problem in for performance while the constraint in \autoref{eq:rl} is enforced for robustness against the quantizer gain. Similar to the previous example, Lemma~\ref{lem:gkyp} is applied to the $r \rightarrow e$ sensitivity channel and Lemma~\ref{lem:gkyp} along with conditions in \autoref{eq:gkyp-ifi} to the $w \rightarrow z$ robustness channel. While a sufficient condition for stability would be that the root locus remains in the stable region for all positive quantizer gains \gls{K}, this produces a very conservative design. Instead, the quantizer gain robustness criterion can be used to enhance the stable input range of the design from \autoref{sec:ex-hinf}. Instability in sigma delta modulators is often associated with low quantizer gains. To improve stability, the lower bound of the quantizer gain, $k_l$, may be changed and the optimization problem solved. Thus $k_l$ is a parameter that trades off performance and stability, which is shown in \autoref{fig:robust-perf-stab}. With some trial-and-error, $k_l=0.1$ results in a modulator that is full-scale stable under simulation. The solver converges to the loop transfer function:

\begin{equation*}
	H_1(z) = \frac{1.80\left(z - 0.806\right)\left(z - 0.641\right)\left(z^2 - 1.93z + 0.949\right)}{\left(z - 0.607\right)\left(z^2 - 1.94z + 0.943\right)\left(z^2 - 1.98z + 0.990\right)}.
\end{equation*}

\end{figure}

The robustness and sensitivity channels are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ntf-rl}. The \gls{Hinf} norm of the $G_{zw}(z)$ transfer function is less than 1 for all frequencies, showing that the system is stable for all norm-bounded quantizer gains in the range $\left[k_l, k_h\right] = \left[0.1, \infty\right)$. The root locus shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rl-rl} confirms that this is the case. A simulation like done previously shows that system is empirically stable for input amplitudes up to \gls{FS}. As expected when stability is increased, the empirical peak SQNR is reduced to \SI{66}{\deci\bel} with the minimum resolvable input amplitude at \SI{-52}{\deci\bel} \gls{FS}.

\section{Design Using \gls{H2} Stability Criterion}
\label{sec:ex-h2}

The \gls{H2} design technique is done by again solving the optimization problem in \autoref{eq:perf} for performance while maintaining the stability constraint from \autoref{eq:h2}. The former uses Lemma~\ref{lem:gkyp} while the latter uses Theorem~\ref{thm:h2}. In this example, the goal is to design a modulator for the same specifications as that from \autoref{sec:ex-hinf} but with slightly increased stability. One advantage of the \gls{H2} criterion is that there is a more systematic way to target a specific \gls{MSIA}. For this example, the quantizer input signal is modelled with the Gaussian \gls{PDF}. For a target \gls{MSIA} of 0.68, the criterion is satisfied if $||G_{er}(z)||^2_2<1.79$. Using this constraint along with the performance optimization, the solver converges. Even after many iterations, the \gls{LF} contains a pole-zero near cancellation indicating that the optimization scheme was not able to find a feasible 5th-order design. After simplification, the 4th-order \gls{LF} transfer function is:

\begin{equation*}
	H_1(z) = \frac{0.599\left(z - 0.654\right)\left(z^2 - 1.93z + 0.966\right)}{\left(z^2 - 1.97z + 0.972\right)\left(z^2 - 1.99z + 0.995\right)}.
\end{equation*}

Computing the NTF gain using the scale invariance procedure from \autoref{sec:stab-si}, an optimum value of $K = 0.877$ is obtained and the \gls{H2} criterion predicts stability for input signals less than 0.69 \gls{FS}. Because this stability criteria is only an approximation, the empirical \gls{MSIA} is 0.78. The peak SQNR was found to be \SI{80}{\deci\bel} at an input amplitude of 0.73. The minimum resolvable input amplitude was found to be \SI{-84}{\deci\bel} \gls{FS}. The \gls{SQNR} versus input amplitude measurements can be seen in \autoref{fig:sqnr-h2} and the trade-off between performance and stability as the \gls{H2} target is swept is shown in \autoref{fig:h2-perf-stab}.

\end{figure}

\section{Design Using \gls{l1} Stability Criterion}
\label{sec:ex-l1}

In this example, the \gls{l1} method is used to create a modulator design that is mathematically guaranteed to be stable for a range of input amplitudes by solving the \gls{GKYP} optimization problem while using the \gls{starnorm} constraint. This constraint is only an upper bound on the \gls{l1} norm, so there is some trial-and-error to find this \gls{starnorm} upper bound that produces the desired $\ell_1$ norm bound. In this case, running the optimization problem with a $\star$-norm constraint of $4$ results in $||G_{er}(z)||_1 = 2.32$ and a loop filter as follows:

\begin{equation*}
	H_1(z) = \frac{0.602\left(z^2 - 1.69z + 0.718\right)}{\left(z - 0.891\right)\left(z^2 - 1.949z + 0.955\right)}.
\end{equation*}

This design is guaranteed to be stable for input amplitudes up to 0.68 \gls{FS}, but empirical stability is seen for the entire input range. The cost for this stability is a decrease in performance: a peak \gls{SQNR} of \SI{59}{\deci\bel} and a minimum resolvable input amplitude of \SI{-41}{\deci\bel} FS. Note that similar to the case in \autoref{sec:ex-h2}, there are now 2 pole-zero cancellations in the final loop filter resulting in an order 3 transfer function. The \gls{NTF} for this design can been seen in Figure~\ref{fig:ntf-l1}. The simulated performance along with the simulated and guaranteed stability is shown for various \gls{starnorm} goals in \autoref{fig:l1-perf-stab}.

\section{Discussion of the Above Examples}
For the problem of digitizing an \gls{EEG} signal, the \gls{Hinf} design provides a relatively good balance of \gls{SQNR} and \gls{MSIA} over a wide range of Lee criterion values. However, there are diminishing returns when increasing the allowable out-of-band gain and the design fails for very high or very low Lee criterion targets. In addition, it is not clear the exact relationship between the Lee criterion and the stability before a series of designs are produced. The root locus method has a more intuitive meaning but the achieved performance and stability may vary with only small changes in the design target. The \gls{H2} design method produced the highest \gls{SQNR} for some optimization targets with a smoother performance-stability trade-off. As expected, the \gls{l1} procedure is extremely conservative and requires a long computation time to arrive at a reasonable set of filter coefficients.

\section{\titlecap{\glsentrylong{CT}} Design}
\label{sec:ex-ct}

To examine how the optimization framework may be used to directly produce \gls{CT} designs, a 3rd order \gls{CT} sigma delta modulator is produced for audio applications. Due to the absence of stability criteria that may be directly applied to continuous-time designs, the following constraints are used:

\begin{gather}
	\min_{\omega \in [0, 2\pi\cdot4.41\times10^5]} ||G_{er}(j\omega)||_\infty \quad \textrm{s.t.} \label{eq:ct-con1} \\
	||G_{er}(j\omega)||_\infty \leq \SI{4}{\deci\bel} \quad \forall \omega \label{eq:ct-con2} \\
	||G_{yr}(j\omega)||_\infty \leq \SI{-10}{\deci\bel} \quad \omega \in [2\pi\cdot7.056\times10^5, \infty) \label{eq:ct-con3}
\end{gather}

The constraint in \autoref{eq:ct-con1} uses \autoref{eq:perf} to minimize the in-band noise of the sensitivity function. The constraint in \autoref{eq:ct-con2} favours stability by placing a maximum gain on the \gls{NTF}. Unlike discrete-time designs, there is no influence of the quantizer sampling frequency captured in the first two constraints. Thus, the constraint in \autoref{eq:ct-con3} is used to force high roll-off by reducing the \gls{STF} outside the signal band.

The optimization process converges on the loop filter transfer function:

\begin{equation*}
	\frac{1.11\times10^8\left(s^2 + 3.25\times10^6 + 1.178\times10^{13}\right)}{\left(s + 2.37\times10^8\right)\left(s^2 + 3.80\times10^4 + 3.94\times10^{10}\right)},
\end{equation*}

for which the sensitivity and complementary sensitivity functions are shown in \autoref{fig:ntf-ct} and the spectrum of the simulated quantizer output is shown in \autoref{fig:fft-ct}.

\section{Summary of Design Examples}
\label{sec:ex-compare}

In \autoref{sec:ex-hinf}, a set of constraints was proposed to design a sigma delta modulator in a way similar to the Delta Sigma Toolbox. A lower \gls{Hinf} norm across the \gls{STF} signal band was achieved but the simulation performance was very close to the Toolbox result. The modulator exhibited a well-defined onset of instability that was reasonably well correlated with the \gls{Hinf} norm target up to a point ($||G_{er}(z)||_\infty > 2$) where the design was completely unstable. Diminishing returns of peak \gls{SQNR} were seen as the Lee criterion was increased above 1.6.  When the root locus robustness criteria was used in \autoref{sec:ex-rl}, choosing a low $k_l$ restricted the root locus to entirely within the unit circle and, as expected, produced designs stable to \gls{FS}. As $k_l$ was increased, the peak \gls{SQNR} increased and \gls{MSIA} decreased, but not as smoothly as in the Lee criterion case. Both the Lee criterion and root locus design methods yielded similar peak \gls{SQNR} values for some value of the criterion. The \gls{H2} design method from \autoref{sec:ex-h2} produced a pronounced peak \gls{SQNR} after which the \gls{MSIA} began to decrease rather than the abrupt unstable region seen with the previous designs. The Gaussian \gls{PDF} seemed slightly conservative for this example, as the predicted \gls{MSIA} was consistently about \SI{2}{\deci\bel} lower than the simulation. The \gls{l1} design in \autoref{sec:ex-l1} was very conservative because it not only uses the worst-case \gls{l1} stability criterion, but conservativeness also propagates from the \gls{starnorm} approximation and solving of the \gls{BMI}. Despite the simulations being stable to \gls{FS} for all \gls{starnorm} targets attempted, the method managed to produce an acceptable 3rd-order design. Finally, the \gls{CT} example did not produce a very useful modulator likely due to the choice of constraints, but did show that the method can be applied directly to the \gls{CT} class of modulators.
