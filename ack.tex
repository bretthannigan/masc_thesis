\chapter{Acknowledgments}

I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. Guy Dumont for his support of my research as well as the other members of the BC Children's Hospital Research Institute's Digital Health Innovation Lab team.

I gratefully acknowledge the funding received from industry partner ESS Technologies whose participation in the Mitacs Accelerate program allowed me to explore this project. The staff at ESS have been especially helpful, many thanks to Martin Mallinson and Chris Petersen in particular whose enthusiastic technical guidance and anecdotes about electronics, mathematics, and computing were a source of inspiration. Finally, thank you to the others who attended my progress meetings and provided valuable feedback.
