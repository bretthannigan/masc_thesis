\chapter{Lay Summary}

The goal of this work was a method to better design analog-to-digital converters with special interest to recording weak bio-signals, such as those from electroencephalography and electrocardiography.

The sigma delta architecture of analog-to-digital converters is known for having high resolution for signals of this class while requiring fewer expensive analog circuit components. However, as its performance is increased, it tends to become unstable, a point at which the digitized signal no longer accurately represents the original.

To this end, a theory and set of software tools were developed that use mathematical optimization and control theory to design sigma delta circuits with varying degrees of performance and stability. It is even possible to generate a design that is guaranteed to be stable. The method is generalizable to any kind of signal, medical or otherwise. These developments were used to analyze and synthesize designs and will hopefully inspire future high-resolution analog-to-digital converters.
